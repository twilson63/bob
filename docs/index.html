<p>Welcome to the BOB project! This project is about software design/architecture. 
What is software architecture and why is it important?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="Splitting-Atoms.jpg" alt="Splitting Atoms"></p>
<p>The measure of design quality is the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer. </p>
<h4 id="if-that-effort-is-low-and-stays-low-throughout-the-lifetime-of-the-system-the-design-is-good">If that effort is <code>low</code>, and stays <code>low</code> throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good.</h4>
<h4 id="if-that-effort-is-high-and-stays-high-throughout-the-lifetime-of-the-system-the-design-is-bad">If that effort is <code>high</code>, and stays <code>high</code> throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is bad.</h4>

<h2 id="why-think-about-architecturedesign">Why think about architecture/design?</h2>
<p>From working in a startup organization to a high growth organization, new features and shifting of priorities is
 a constant battle. If the engineering team chooses just to react to these by just choosing the easiest way forward at a given time, without properly thinking through the long term costs. The product could end up in a situation where every new feature&#39;s cost and time to market increases exponentially. This requires more resources and
time to continually ship a product of high quality. By building quality into the project and implementing a design that separates boundaries of functionality, we can design systems that keep the overhead of implementing features to a reasonable minimum cost. We can also keep the time to build features low through the lifetime of the system. It becomes easier to build and maintain reliable automated tests that focus on testing the use cases of a
 system and when the test break it is a high signal of a true issue. It becomes easier for developers to work concurrently on different features without having to create long-lived branches and deal with painful merge requests.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-pain-points-will-a-clean-architecture-approach-avoid">What kind of pain points will a clean architecture approach avoid?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The need for long lived feature branches and painful merges to master, ie continuous deployment.</li>
<li>Having to touch several areas to complete or manage adding use cases between other use cases, ie spagetti code.</li>
<li>Having to work in coordination with several teams to get initiatives completed, ie bad abstractions early.</li>
<li>Able to modify/upgrade implementation details without having to re-write reliable tests or use cases, ie separation of concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-bob">What is BOB?</h2>
<p>BOB is a bundler used to help create clean software architecture. By enabling the inversion of dependency with implementation details using the facade pattern. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This means, that the bob module can compose one or more objects together for a single grouping of pure business rules that can access implementation details like database gateways without having to explicity depend on these gateways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These objects are called business objects, they are a group of functions that perform the use cases of an application, or you can think of them as the business rules or policies of your application. By making these objects and functions pure, which means they do not depend on any implementation details, then you can wrap a whole test system around them without having to include the database or web or framework.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-business-object">What is a Business Object?</h3>
<p>A business object is a collection of business rules for your application. 
Business rules are what makes your application unique and special, these rules 
are usually defined in terms of entities and iterators, or simply use cases. When
architecting or designing your application the first mission is to define the use 
cases. These use cases frame the requirements of your application.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-implementation-details">What are Implementation Details?</h2>
<p>Implementation Details are mostly side effect interfaces to your application, you can think of the following as implementation details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Access Layer or DAL</li>
<li>GUI Framework or API Framework</li>
<li>Services</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that all arrows of your details are pointing to the Business Objects as dependencies and that your Business Objects do not depend on your implementation details.</p>
<p><code>API Framework --&gt; Business Objects &lt;-- Gateway --&gt; DAL</code></p>
<p>It is also important that you can run integration tests and unit tests without any implementation detail.</p>
<p><code>Testing Framework --&gt; Business Objects &lt;-- Gateway --&gt; MockDAL</code></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">const createBob = require(&#39;@twilson63/bob&#39;)

const Person = require(&#39;./person&#39;)
const User = require(&#39;./user&#39;)
const Permission = require(&#39;./permission&#39;)

const gateway = require(&#39;./gateway&#39;)

const bob = createApp(
  // business objects - policies
  [Person, User, Permission], 
  // details
  { gateway: gateway}
)

bob.person.create({ name: &#39;Tom Wilson&#39;})
  .then(res =&gt; console.log(res))
  .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err))
</code></pre>
<p>In this example we are bundling the Person, User and Permission business objects into a single 
bundle or business component, we are also including our database gateway or access layer as an implementation
detail.</p>
<p>This approach allows for the person create use case to leverage the gateway interface to persist the object, 
but the business object can validate the person object and apply any rules or calculations before persisting
to a data store. Once persisted it can check for success and return a successful result or return an error.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-i-need-this-abstraction">Why do I need this abstraction?</h3>
<p>Good question, the main reason is flexibility, by abstracting your business rules and creating a boundry between your details like api framework or database, these details can be changed without changing your business rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about it for a minute, what if every requirement or every user change request or new use case could be managed in one defined location, so when the stakeholder changes their mind it does not effect or touch several design components in the system.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to think about it, is that stakeholders change their minds all the time, they may want the workflow
to go right, then they may want it to go left, etc. By placing all of those decisions in your <code>BusinessObjects</code> 
and decoupling them from your database or api framework, then you can change a lot of the business objects 
control flow and strategies without having to change your framework or database. This means you can wrap a whole test framework around your business objects and you will be able to test a significant amount of your features 
using integration or unit testing libraries without having to load your whole database or api framework.</p>
<p>Having all of your business rules wrapped with reliable testing adds confidence to the engineering team. It does take effort up front, but the payoff is maintainable code, with a consistent amount of effort to maintain over time.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-a-tool-like-business-object-bundler-why-not-just-create-my-business-objects-and-manage-them-without-a-bundle">Why use a tool like business object bundler? Why not just create my business objects and manage them without a bundle?</h3>
<p>The purpose of the bundler is to give you a way to compose these objects together so that you can create 
and refactor the business object boundaries without having explicit dependencies between the objects or 
the implementation details. There are certainly other ways to accommplish this, but this process can 
save you a lot of time and effort.</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>The api for BOB is a single function, it takes two arguments, an array of business objects and a
object of details and returns a bundle object.</p>
<pre><code>([...businessObjects], {details}) -&gt; {bundle}</code></pre><p>This bundle object can be used to invoke the use cases defined by the business objects.</p>
<p>Each business object must have a name property that returns a unique string. This string will be
used to access the business object use cases on the bundle.</p>
<p>Then each method on the business object, must be a higher order method that returns a function, which represents the use case function. </p>
<p>By defining the object with a name property and setting each function as a higher order function to receive implementation details via the returning function invocation, you can create a clean separation between your business rules and implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="business-objects">Business Objects</h3>
<p>Business Objects are plain javascript objects that have two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must always have a name property that returns a string, this needs to be unique in the bundle</li>
<li>Every function is a higher order function that returns a function that will contain the initialized
implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business Object implement application use cases these use cases can be represented as functions attached
to the business object. Often these functions will need to perform calculations, communicate with other
objects and implementation details. Using these use case functions you can get access to other business
objects or details by creating a manual curry or higher order function, or you can leverage curry to 
do the same.</p>
<h4 id="business-object-example">Business Object Example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">const { has } = require(&#39;ramda&#39;)

function validatePerson (person) {
  return has(&#39;name&#39;, person)
}

module.exports = {
  name: &#39;person&#39;,
  create: (person) =&gt; ({ details }) =&gt; {
    if (validatePerson(person)) {
      return details.gateway.save(person)
    }
    return Promise.reject({ok: false, message: &#39;Invalid&#39;})
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have a Business Object with a use case, called person.create, we want to add it to our application, lets say we have an express api framework.</p>
<pre><code>const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)
const app = express()

const createBundle = require(&#39;@twilson63/bob&#39;)
const person = require(&#39;./person&#39;)
const gateway = require(&#39;./data/gateway&#39;)

const bundle = createBundle([person], [gateway])

app.post(&#39;/people&#39;, async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await bundle.person.create(req.body)

})

app.listen(3000)
</code></pre><p>By bundling up the person business object we can inject the data gateway and keep all of the business objects in a boundry where the business objects do not depend on the details directly. This can loosely couple our business rules to the framework and database. Which means that the business objects are easy to test without requiring a database or web framework.</p>
<p><code>Framework</code> --&gt;  <code>Business Objects</code> &lt;-- <code>Database Gateway</code></p>
<p>The more decisions of our application we can place in these business objects, the better we can become at creating reliable testable applications. And manage change over time.</p>
<h3 id="packaging-options">Packaging Options</h3>
<p>You can certainly package bob and business objects anywhere, but give some good thought on how you want to partition your business objects for your application. Also the displine required to implement through the dependency process. By separating layers using package components maybe worth the effort to risk developer taking short cuts.</p>
<p>Using <code>yarn workspaces</code> is a great way to separate the concerns within a project repository.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/">Yarn Workspaces</a></p>
<p>In your root directory add a package.json file then within the package.json file add a workspaces node that takes an array of module folders. This will allow modules from that folder to be referenced within another module.</p>
<pre><code>\
  - bundle
    - objects
    - dal
    - package.json
  - app
    - node_modules
      - [bundle]
    - src
      - index.js
      - components
  - README.md
  - package.json</code></pre><p>You can keep your dependencies pure and inverted in your architecture or design.</p>
<p>While this pattern keeps your boundaries strong, there are other benefits to this design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>Swapping Implementation Details</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="everything-should-be-testable-without-the-database-and-the-web">Everything should be testable without the database and the web.</h3>
<p>By separating your business rules from the implementation details, you are able to create <code>reliable</code> test plans that can be run in any environment that can run your application, without depending on the web, or a database etc. This can give your team a lot of confidence in building and adding features to the product, when something breaks it is high signal and not a design smell.</p>
<h3 id="guess-what-things-change">Guess what things change.</h3>
<p>Overtime an successful application will continue to get more complex and will require modification, or frameworks will become obsolete, or databases will need to be re-architected. How can you protect your application from these changing implementation details? With a clean architecture you can turn these migrations into managable migrations that can be planned and executed on time in stride to other priorities, and have strong confidence that you will be successful in the migration.</p>
<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do I have to use bob to get the benefits of clean architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>No, bob is one pattern solution that is a little more js functional focused, but there are plenty of ways using oop patterns and/or other patterns to solve the problem. The important requirement is that your business rules/objects do not depend on details, they have strong boundaries between the details and the business rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I slice my architecture/design vertically over time with this implementation? </li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this solution keeps all business objects at the code level isolated on dependencies, but if you create dependencies within your bundle, then it may be harder to break them apart over time. Since they are connected in one place with reliable testing, it should be possible to refactor and separate into vertical components as well as migrate to services as time goes on and the need for reusability and scalability changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why not start with microservices out of the gate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Microservices is not an architecture design as much as it is separating business rules into a distributed system and you may want to consider the overhead required to do this correctly and make sure that these components are truly isolatable. In other words if you find new use cases being introduced touching several services then they are not really isolated. Or if you find that you have to load several microservices on your system in order to develop, then you have split connected business rules into different places and should consider consolidating them back into a single component. The goal with architecture is to minimize the work to maintain a system not to increase it as the system grows in complexity. Starting with microservices out of the gate does nothing but increase the complexity and maintenance burden without validation of scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if my current app has business rules all over the place?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no reason to not start to migrate your current applications to this architecture pattern, you may want to start with new features or new use cases, or as you go in to change existing use cases, create a plan to extract the business rules from your database layer, or framework layer. You don&#39;t have to change everything, but just start changing the things right in front of you. Write some tests against your business rules, put them in your ci/cd system. Eventually, you will need to change databases, or web interfaces or api interfaces, by starting to separate your business rules from your details, it will make this process easier. </p>
<ul>
<li>My Database is the center of my application, won&#39;t this create a problem with this kind of architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many applications have this challenge, it is a discussion you should have with your team, but making the database the center of the application can create a marriage with that database and make it impossible to divorce in the future. Try to imagine a situation where your database vendor is going out of business or decides to stop supporting that product, what are you going to do? Databases are great tools and have a lot of value in creating optimizations to store data, but the business rules should not be embedded within the database. If you are in a situation where your rules are inside the database you can start a migration process to move them out over time and set your team up to create a plan to migrate the rules from the database to a set of system components.</p>
<ul>
<li>My framework is the center of my application, how do I migrate to a clean architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many frameworks encourage you to marry them by adding your business rules to the framework itself, while it makes it hard to divorce, it is still possible, by drawing a line in the sand between your view/controllers and your models, you can start to separate the business rules into their own components and refactor your test suites to focus on testing the business rules. Then your dependency on the framework becomes a detail that can swapped out when the need arises.</p>
